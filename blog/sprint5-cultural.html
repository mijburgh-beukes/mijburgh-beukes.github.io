                        <p>
                            <strong>What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</strong>
                            <br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>That once I fully grasp a concept, I tend to get a lot more confident and excited about tackling more difficult problems.</li>
                                <li>I've most definitely got the capacity to learn new concepts, but getting better at those things will take time and practice.</li>
                                <li>Speed kills, sometimes. I can get too eager to jump into doing an exercise and neglect reading the whole thing properly or coming up with a plan for success.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>                                
                        <p>
                            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</strong>
                            <br>
                            Values will guide your decision making on what work to take on and how to deal with people that don't treat you in a manner that aligns with those values. Empathy will help you work with people from all walks of life, as well as facilitate the building of relationships. That, combined with self awareness will aid in preventing and/or resolving any conflicts you might encounter. A healthy self awareness will also help you overcome any learning obstacles, as you will be able to recognise when you are getting down on yourself and utilise other tools in you skillset to get you out of that funk.
                        </p>    
                        <p>
                            <strong>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong>
                            <br>
                            Listening and looping was amazing. It's such a good exercise, as it helps you develop your mindfullness, self awareness and your empathy skills.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
                            <br>
                            The identity and values exploration was quite an intense exercise. Reflecting on who you really are can sometimes be uncomfortable and bring up things that you're not necessarily wanting to, but incredibly valuable when you take it seriously, as it can really help you evaluate what's important to you and your situation in life.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</strong>
                            <br>
                            The pandemic has brought working practices into stark perspective. Remote working is going to become a much more readily accepted option for businesses, and as I personally have experienced during the lockdown, online communication can be tricky at times. Therefore, have good HR skills is an absolute must in that situation, as is when working as part of a team, which is what a lot of programmers end up doing. The core components of the course just helps you become a more well-rounded and resilient person and programmer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
                            <br>
                            In short, no. The core learning has really had a positive effect on how I learn as well as keeping up my determination to push through difficult situations (in a problem solving sense).
