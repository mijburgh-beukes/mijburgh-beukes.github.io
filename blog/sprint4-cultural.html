                    By having the process of learning be the reward, rather than receiving a reward for being able to find the solution, you are more likely to make lasting learning connections in your brain. Practicing a newly learned piece of information and applying it to a project that is relevant to your own life experience will drastically increase the uptake and embedding of that information. Knowing that failing often at the start of learning a new concept is a great way to remove any preconceptions you might have about your own abilities in terms of learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ways to improve neuroplasticity are:</strong> Learning new languages, Try new things, read as much as possible, stay curious, get enough sleep, exercise, meditate, stay hydrated, manage stress levels, maintain a social life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Ways to improve memory:</strong> Avoiding distractions, learning in chunks, associative learning, memory games, minimise interruptions, take regular breaks, optimise background sounds, practice mindfulness.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main takeaways for me are: in order to strengthen your learning, you need to practice the newly learned concepts; reviewing what you have learned and explaining it in a single sentence also helps strengthen the new neural pathways you have developed.

                    Growth mindsets allow you to learn more effectively by avoiding preconceived (often negative) ideas you have about your own abilities. Fixed mindsets are the exact opposite to that and inhibit your learning ability. <blockquote class="text-muted"><em>In this mindset, the hand you’re dealt is just the starting point for development.</em></blockquote>
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have realised that for a lot of my professional life I’ve extended myself in some areas by utilising a growth mindset, but have hamstrung myself in others by adopting a fixed mindset.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having a <a href="https://www.mindsetworks.com/science/" class="text-info">‘not yet’</a> mindset can vastly improve your learning capabilities and resilience. Confidence can be a product of determination, will power and perseverance. Believing that your abilities can be developed can be a determining factor in your success. How do you eat an elephant? One mouthful at a time. Prove your ability to yourself in small ways enough times and you’ll become confident in them, creating a positive feedback loop. 
                </p>

                    Going into the bootcamp portion of the course, I will constantly remind myself that when I’m facing a problem, I will get it wrong sometimes, but in that process I will be learning. I will stop seeking approval from and comparing myself to others. Instead, I will celebrate my growth with others and  also learn from others’ mistakes. I will also think realistically about time and effort. At times it takes me a bit longer to learn something properly than the suggested timebox. I’d be better off focussing on that until I’ve figured it out, rather than extending my knowledge to other areas, which I can do in my own time. Lastly, I will take ownership of my growth mindset attitude.
