    <h1 class="blog-head">Configuration & Customization</h1>
    <h2>Configuration with classes</h2>
    <p>Classes and ids are wonderful things. They allow you to do some pretty nifty things and can be reused endlessly for specific applications within your html. They do however need to be used correctly. You can compare their differences to buying a brand new Audi off their website.</p>
    <p>Classes can be thought of as configuration options when buying your Audi. Let's think of car models as different html text elements. For this example we'll be comparing the Audi A1 and A4.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>

        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>We can apply red paint (class="paint-red") to both of them. They are different cars, but they're styled the same way.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Next we can create paint option that is unique to the different models: A1 class="paint" and A4 class="paint". In the the CSS file, you'd create a selector that targets these specific elements to give them their unique color: A1.paint { color: bright-gold; } and A4.paint { color: pearl-charcoal; }.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now, we haven't specified a generic paint class in our CSS, so applying class="paint" to anything other than an A1 or A4 in this example, will leave it devoid of styling.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h2>Building on existing Classes</h2>

    <p>Let's give the A4 a butt-lift. If we build a new class="Avant", this changes the A4 'element' from a white Sedan to a red Station Wagon. The CSS would look like .Avant { color: red; shape: wagon}.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now let's change things up by making the car more sporty. We can give it a different colour, add window tints and call it an S4 Avant. The html would be "<"A4 class="Avant S4">" and the CSS would be .Avant.S4 { color: midnight-blue; windows: tinted; }.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The S4 isn't racey enough, so let's make an 'R' model. We want to keep both the body shape (.Avant) and the tinted windows (.S4), but we want to change the colour and add a wide body kit. The html would be "<"A4 class="Avant R S4">" and the CSS would be .Avant.R.S4 { colour: green; kit: wide-body;}.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>By combining classes like this, you can build a base style (.Avant) with all the necessary attributes, and just add to and/or change attributes for different effects, but keeping some things in tact.</p>

    <h2>Customization with an id</h2>

    <p>An id selector is used in the same way as a single class (A1 id="look-custom"), but should only be used once on a single item for an entire page.</p>
    <p>This can be thought of as getting a custom paint job and contrasting roof colour for your Audi A1. The CSS would look like this: #look-custom { paint: lime; roof: contrast; }.</p>

    <figure>
        <img src="" alt="" class="img-fluid">
        <figcaption>
            
        </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Customising something means it should be unique, and trying to emulate it can lead to disappointment. Going to a body shop that uses sub par paint that looks the same as a custom job will end up with problems down the line. In the same way, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors#ID_Selectors">"Using the same ID multiple times in a document may appear to work for styling purposes, but don't do this. It results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many places."</a></p>
