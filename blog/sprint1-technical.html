    <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
    
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

                  <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-4">Configuration with classes</h2>
                  <p>Classes and ids are wonderful things. They allow you to do some pretty nifty things and can be reused endlessly for specific applications within your html. They do however need to be used correctly. You can compare their differences to buying a brand new Audi off their website.</p>
                  <p>Classes can be thought of as configuration options when buying your Audi. Let's think of car models as different html text elements. For this example we'll be comparing the Audi A1 and&nbsp;A4.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A1.jpg" alt="Base Audi A1" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption>Stock Audi A1</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A4.jpg" alt="Base Audi A4" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption>Stock Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>We can apply red paint <strong>class="paint-red"</strong> to both of them. They are different cars, but they're styled the same way.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/PaintRed-A1.jpg" alt="Red Audi A1" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>.paint-red</strong> Audi A1</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/PaintRed-A4.jpg" alt="Red Audi A4" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>.paint-red</strong> Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>Next we can create paint option that is unique to the different models: <strong>A1 class="paint"</strong> and <strong>A4 class="paint"</strong>. In the the CSS file, you'd create a selector that targets these specific elements to give them their unique color: <strong>A1.paint { color: bright-gold;}</strong> and <strong>A4.paint { color: pearl-charcoal;}</strong>.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A1.Paint.jpg" alt="Bright Gold Audi A1" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>A1.paint</strong> Audi A1</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A4.Paint.jpg" alt="Pearl Charcoal Audi A4" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>A4.paint</strong> Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>Now, we haven't specified a generic paint class in our CSS, so applying class="paint" to anything other than an A1 or A4 in this example, will leave it devoid of styling.</p>
              
                  <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Building on existing Classes</h2>
              
                  <p>Let's give the A4 a butt-lift. If we build a new class="Avant", this changes the A4 'element' from a white Sedan to a red Station Wagon. The CSS would look like <strong>.Avant { color: red; shape: wagon;}</strong>.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A4.jpg" alt="Base Audi A4" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption>Stock Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A4.Avant.jpg" alt="Red Audi A4 Avant" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>.Avant</strong> Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>Now let's change things up by making the car more sporty. We can give it a different colour, add window tints and call it an S4 Avant. The html would be <strong>A4 class="Avant S4"</strong> and the CSS would be <strong>.Avant.S4 {color: midnight-blue; windows:&nbsp;tinted;}</strong>.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/S4.Avant.jpg" alt="Midnight Blue Audi S4 Avant" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>.Avant.S4</strong> Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>The S4 isn't racey enough, so let's make an 'R' model. We want to keep both the body shape - <strong>.Avant</strong> -  and the tinted windows <strong>S4</strong>, but we want to change the colour and add a wide body kit. The html would be <strong>A4 class="Avant R S4</strong> and the CSS would be <strong>.Avant.R.S4 { colour: green; kit: wide-body;}</strong>.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/R.S4.Avant.jpg" alt="Green Audi RS4 Avant" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>.Avant.R.S4</strong> Audi A4</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p>By combining classes like this, you can build a base style (.Avant) with all the necessary attributes, and just add to and/or change attributes for different effects, but keeping some things in tact.</p>
              
                  <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Customization with an id</h2>
              
                  <p>An id selector is used in the same way as a single class <strong>A1 id="look-custom"</strong>, but should only be used once on a single item for an entire page.</p>
                  <p>This can be thought of as getting a custom paint job and contrasting roof colour for your Audi A1. The CSS would look like this: <strong>#look-custom { paint: lime; roof: contrast;}</strong>.</p>
              
                  <figure>
                    <img src="../img/A1.idCustom.jpg" alt="Custom Lime Audi A1" class="img-fluid">
                    <figcaption><strong>#look-custom</strong> Audi A1</figcaption>
                  </figure>
              
                  <p id="legends">Customising something means it should be unique, and trying to emulate it can lead to disappointment. Going to a body shop that uses sub par paint that looks the same as a custom job will end up with problems down the line. In the same way, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/Selectors/Type_Class_and_ID_Selectors#ID_Selectors" class="text-info">"Using the same ID multiple times in a document may appear to work for styling purposes, but don't do this. It results in invalid code, and will cause strange behavior in many places."</a> So be careful when you use id's. One of the most usefull ways to implement id's is to create page anchors.
