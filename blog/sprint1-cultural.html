    <h1>The Story of Te Houtaewa (PAGE heading)</h1>
    <h2>E kore e mau i a koe, he wae kai pakiaka. <em>A foot accustomed to running over roots makes the speediest runner.</em> (Optional SUB title) </h2>
    <h3>10 November 2010</h3>
    
    <p>
      Te Houtaewa was the fastest runner of his day and played many pranks on his peoples enemies. One morning his mother wanted kumara for the hangi (earth oven) and asked Te Houtaewa to go to the gardens at Te Kao, a short distance away. He agreed to fetch the kumara and told his mother to prepare the hangi.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instead of going to the nearby gardens, Te Houtaewa set off for Ahipara as he wanted to annoy some Te Rarawa people who lived there. Carrying two large baskets for the kumara, he ran like the wind, completing the journey over the hard sands of Te Oneroa a Tohe (Ninety Mile Beach) in the few hours it takes a good hangi to heat up properly. On reaching Ahipara, he went straight to the people's kumara pataka (storehouse for the sweet potatoes) situated at the foot of the hill Whangatauatia.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Te Houtaewa was filling his baskets with kumara he was spotted stealing the kai (food). He was immediately recognised.

                <h1 class="blog-head" id="learning-plan">My learning plan</h1>
                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-4">Long term life and career goals</h2>
                <p>In the short term, I’d like to find a job where I can hone the skills and expand on the knowledge I’ve gained during my time at EDA. Long term, I would like to help shift our society towards one that is more sustainable: <strong>socially, economically and environmentally</strong>. What does this look like?</p>
                
                <p>Companies and organisations that have B Corp status would be an example of someone I’d either like to work for or with. I would need to be able to build web-based and standalone tools to help achieve their aspirational goals. This means I’d need to be able to extend my language set and technology base beyond what I learn on this course, so I’d need to learn enough to be able to do that.</p>
            
                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Human skills development</h2>
            
                <p>In order to be as effective as possible in reaching my goals, I will need to be able to lead a team effectively. This will require learning how to inspire people, how to coach and develop them, and to manage my time more efficiently.
                </p>
            
                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Strengths and limitations</h2>
                <h3>Strengths</h3>
                <p>Empathy, Curiosity, Objectivity & analysis, Building and maintaining relationships, self-starter.</p>

                <h3>Limitations</h3>
                <p>Following through on things; procrastinate when facing a problem where I don’t know how to start it; perfectionism.</p>


                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Managing my bootcamp workload</h2>
            
                <p>Be intentional about my <strong>goals and challenges</strong> for the day and share them with an accountability partner. Ideally, I would write them down the night before and reassess before my day starts officially. At the moment, our schedule during parts of bootcamp hasn’t been confirmed yet, but as soon as I know what it will look like, I will discuss any potential issues with my facilitator and any affected peers. I have <strong>suspended all work</strong> arrangements during bootcamp and I will have organised any necessary childcare arrangements so that I can completely focus on my course. I will also set up an <strong>office away from home</strong> so that I won’t be disturbed at all. In order to <strong>avoid burnout</strong>, I will make sure to get <strong>exercise</strong> in and help with domestic chores during the 2 hour lunch break each day. I will also try to work in 9 holes of golf on Saturday afternoons :D Also, I will do my utmost to not waist time on small things only designers would notice.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Seeking help</h2>
            
                <p>If I am struggling with something and one of my peers can’t help me and using the Rubber Ducky approach doesn’t work, I will post a query on the relevant slack channels after the second attempt. If I fail a third time to solve the problem, I will contact my facilitator directly to get coached in the right direction. Ideally, after having listened to my problem and looked at how I’ve tried to solve it, I wouldn’t want the facilitation team to give me the answer, but rather ask me questions so that I can unearth the solution for myself, which will help me to learn. I thrive on building relationships with people, so ideally I would be paired with facilitators who don’t mind sharing things they are passionate about.</p>

                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Last but not least</h2>
            
                <p>My overriding goal will be to be successful in my learning during this course, but I do have a young family and once I have a clearer view of what our schedule will look like during bootcamp, I will negotiate with the facilitation team any in-course time blocks I would need to dedicate to my family. I will try to keep these to a minimum where possible. After all, I am really enjoying what I’ve been doing so far!</p>

            <div class="col-sm-9">
              <article>
                <h1 class="blog-head">Identity, Values and Strengths</h1>
                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-4">A question of ethics and values</h2>
                
                <p><strong>Values:</strong> Faith, trust, respect, authenticity, peace</p>
                <p><strong>Ethics:</strong> Justice, inclusivity, equality</p>
                
                <p>Whilst at university, I studied to become a graphic designer, and soon after graduating, I landed my first design job with a newspaper. I managed to stay in news-media with Fairfax/Stuff for close to 10 years. The newspaper market has been declining in the internet age, so big corporations like Fairfax have continually made cuts to its workforce.</p>

                <p>In 2015, Fairfax’s Australian Community Media division faced some difficult decisions in order to protect its future. Unless drastic changes were implemented to save costs, they would face having to close 150+ community newspapers, which would also be to the detriment of the communities they served. It was decided that future-proofing their production tools and automating some processes was the way to go.</p>

                <p>I was asked to work on the project to build the new production tools, as I was the only person in the company with specific knowledge in the design software they wanted to leverage. Therefore I was faced with an ethical dilemma: do I work on a project that would result in a large number of job losses? Do I trust that those in authority were motivated by more than just financial reasons?</p>

                <p>My sense of justice told me that it would be better for a relatively small number of people to lose their jobs (which was going to happen regardless) during a relatively stable economic climate at the time, rather than the shuttering of hundreds of newspapers along with the direct job losses and knock-on effects it would have. I decided to accept the secondment to the project and helped build a production platform that is going strong to this day.</p>

                <h3>Cultural influences</h3>

                <p>From a cultural standpoint, faith/religion is a central component of the Afrikaner culture in South Africa. My Christian faith has helped shape my values and ethics. Jesus’ life and actions are a perfect example of what every Christian should strive for in their lifetime, and I believe the values and ethics I have listed reflect that. Am I perfect? Most definitely not, but that’s not an excuse for not trying to be!</p>

                <h2 class="mb-n2 mt-5">Strengths and limitations in learning and working</h2>

                <p><strong>Strengths:</strong> Empathy, Curiosity, Objectivity & analysis, Building and maintaining relationships, self-starter.</p>

                <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Following through on things; procrastinate when facing a problem where I don’t know how to start it; perfectionism.</p>

                <p>One thing that creatives sometimes suffer from is Imposter Syndrome - the sense that your skills are somehow not up to the mark compared to your peers - which can lead to a loss of confidence and self-esteem. I believe this is a form of perfectionism and is a killer when it comes to tackling new problems. It can lead to you not starting something for fear of doing it wrong, or not finishing something you have started for the same reason. I have struggled with this over my lifetime, but with the help of my wife - who is a prolific self-starter - I’ve managed to work on curbing this mentality. Sometimes you just need to get a minimum viable product (MVP) out there and build on it from there.</p>

                <p>My curiosity and analysis should help me in my learning journey and career as a web developer, as they will drive me in finding more of the right information that I need to reach my goals. Self-discipline and self-awareness will be key to keeping this information-gathering within reasonable time-frames though.</p>

                <p>Sometimes curiosity and analysis just might not be enough to tackle certain problems, which is where my relational and empathetic strengths will serve me well: collaboration. I love working with other people to brainstorm and solve difficult problems. Getting pushed to solve seemingly impossible problems is a big driver for me, so having someone that can push me will be of great benefit to me. In turn, I love sharing knowledge in order to help others reach their goals or to solve their own problems.</p>

                <h3>Project management obstacles</h3>

                <p>During my time at Stuff/Fairfax, I was asked to manage part of a big company-wide project. I had 2 peers as part of my team to get through the work in a tight time-frame. One of the team members wasn’t as skilled in the work that we needed to do, which at times created a bit of tension because of a lack of knowledge and experience. When this person was having difficulties keeping up with the work schedule, I used coaching strategies, as well as straight-up training to help them overcome their challenges. In order to be an effective coach/trainer, you need to have empathy and self-awareness, as you need to tailor your approach to the needs of the person you are helping.</p>

                <p>I believe that you can facilitate people’s learning more by using coaching methodologies than just supplying them with the knowledge you have, because coaching involves problem-solving, whereas training just involves the sharing of knowledge. Coaching does however rely on the learner having a base knowledge of the subject, so switching between being a coach and a trainer involves some self-awareness and empathy.</p>

                <h3>Further reflections</h3>

                <p>Before reading any further, there are a couple of definitions I want to make. A person’s <strong>personality</strong> are the behaviours you are <strong>born</strong> with. A person’s <strong>character</strong> are behaviours you personally <strong>choose</strong> apply to your life.</p>

                <p>I have immense respect for the field of Psychology and how psychologists delve into the aspects of your personality. During this process, I have read over my documented strengths, having completed a CliftonStrengths survey a while back. Reading through the different aspects of the key themes of my character, I couldn’t help but compare what has been written to how I see myself personally. Whilst a lot of the things that have been mentioned are accurate, they aren’t necessarily consistently active in my character. It’s an argument of weighting I guess. Weighing up which things apply considerably to your character, and which things you can work on developing further.</p>

                <p>I thrive on building and strengthening personal and professional relationships. Whilst I don’t always go out of my way to build new relationships, I thrive when I’m amongst close friends and family and get opportunities to deepen those relationships.</p>

                <p>One thing that I have learned to be aware of though is being too inquisitive in new relationships. I am curious by nature, which in the context of relationships is driven by my desire to be of service to those whom I love.</p>

                <p>This has been a fantastic exercise, which has been quite revealing at times. I hope that you have enjoyed reading about what makes me tick!</p>
